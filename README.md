### Hi there, I'm Admir Junior ðŸ‘‹

I'm pursuing a masters degree in Neotropical Biodiversity, at the Federal University of Latin-american Integration. 
My research is about the use of deep learning in the ecological modelling.
I'm interested in all things about modelling the ecosystems, from the math to philosophy.
